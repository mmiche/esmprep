Title: Data Preparation During and After the Use of the Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM)
Description: Support in preparing a raw ESM dataset for statistical analysis. Preparation includes the handling of errors (mostly due to technological reasons) and the generating of new variables that are necessary and/or helpful in meeting the conditions when statistically analyzing ESM data. The functions in 'esmprep' are meant to hierarchically lead from bottom, i.e. the raw (separated) ESM dataset(s), to top, i.e. a single ESM dataset ready for statistical analysis. This hierarchy evolved out of my personal experience in working with ESM data.
